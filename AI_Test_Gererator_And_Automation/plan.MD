## 2. Code & API Extraction Module
### 2.1. Spring Java Source Parsing
- Use Java Reflection/AST parsing, Checkstyle/SonarQube, and Spring context analysis
- Extract method/class structure, bean definitions, REST controllers, service endpoints
- Annotate:
  - Method names, parameters, return types
  - REST endpoints, HTTP methods, path variables, request/response types
  - Inter-service communication (Feign, RestTemplate, WebClient)
- Export extracted data (JSON/YAML) for downstream modules

### 2.2. API Contract Parsing
- Use swagger-parser (Java) or openapi-python-client (Python) to:
  - Fetch and read OpenAPI/Swagger files
  - Generate catalog of endpoints, request/response types, parameter constraints
- Export for test and contract test generation

---

## 3. Automated Test Generation Module
### 3.1. Unit Test Generation (Spring)
- Integrate EvoSuite, Diffblue, and custom code analysis:
  - For each Java class, auto-generate JUnit 5 tests
  - Use Mockito for mocking dependencies
  - Use Spring Test for context-aware unit tests
  - Collect output: test classes, coverage reports
- Store generated tests under `/services/<service>/src/generated-tests/unit/`
- Post-process test classes:
  - Reformat per team standards
  - Run static analysis for redundancies

### 3.2. Integration Test Generation (Spring Microservices)
- For each REST controller/service:
  - Generate Spring Boot integration tests using @SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest, etc.
  - Use Testcontainers for real database/message broker dependencies
  - Mock external service calls or spin up dependent services as containers
  - Cover:
    - Standard payloads (per schema)
    - Negative testsâ€”invalid fields, auth errors
    - Boundary conditions (empty/set/max/min values)
- Store under `/services/<service>/src/generated-tests/integration/`

### 3.3. Contract Test Generation
- For each API endpoint:
  - Generate contract tests using Spring Cloud Contract or Pact
  - Validate provider and consumer contracts
  - Ensure compatibility between microservices
- Store contracts and generated tests under `/contracts/` and `/services/<service>/src/generated-tests/contract/`

### 3.4. Test Data Management
- Design modular method to generate/refresh test data:
  - Use Java factory methods, Spring @TestConfiguration, or Python fixtures
  - For boundary-value/edge-case coverage, use pandas/numpy for automated data set expansion
  - Use Docker volumes for persistent test data if needed

---

## 4. ML-Based Test Prioritization Module
### 4.1. Data Preparation
- Aggregate historical run data: test outcomes, execution time, code churn stats, bug reports
- Build unified DataFrame (pandas) for all test cases:
  - Test ID, service, module, code churn delta, last run status, historical flakiness, related defect IDs

### 4.2. Model Design & Development
- Feature engineering: Encode churn, code complexity, past failures, relation to recent code areas
- Select and train initial model (Random Forest or Logistic Regression via scikit-learn) to:
  - Predict probability of failure or bug-find
  - Assign priority score to each test
- Validate model: cross-validation, AUC/ROC metrics

### 4.3. Model Serving & Orchestration
- Package model as Python service (Flask/FastAPI API or CLI script)
- For each CI run:
  - Feed up-to-date test/code data
  - Output prioritized test execution order
- Document API for integration

---

## 5. Edge Case and Scenario Augmentation
### 5.1. Pattern Discovery
- Analyze production logs (ELK stack or log parser scripts) to extract:
  - Rare/untested input patterns
  - Sequences leading to errors
- Rank endpoints and parameters by frequency and error rate

### 5.2. Automatic Edge Test Generation
- For each discovered pattern:
  - Generate additional synthetic tests targeting rare or previously-failing flows
  - Embed in test suite, flagging as 'edge case'

---

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Integration (Microservices)
### 6.1. Job Configuration
- Create pipeline jobs for:
  - Code/API extraction on every commit (per service)
  - Test generation (unit/integration/contract) as nightly build or on PR
  - ML-based prioritization before every test execution
  - Execution of prioritized test suite (fail fast for high-priority failures)
  - Reporting and dashboard update
  - Parallel pipelines for independent microservices
  - Service stubs and Docker Compose for integration/contract tests

### 6.2. Artifact & Notification Handling
- Publish generated tests, coverage, and prioritization reports as CI artifacts
- Integrate email/Slack notifications for failed builds, uncovered areas, or new high-risk paths

### 6.3. Threshold Enforcement
- Set and enforce quality gates:
  - Minimum coverage thresholds (per service)
  - No merge if priority/risk tests fail
  - Contract test pass required for inter-service compatibility

---

## 7. Test Reporting and Analytics
### 7.1. Visualization
- Integrate Allure or ReportPortal for:
  - Coverage over time (trend charts)
  - High-risk area mapping
  - Pass/fail & flakiness heatmaps
  - Microservice health dashboards

### 7.2. Feedback Loops

  - Use labels (reliable/unreliable/false positive)
  - Feed back into ML model for future re-training

---

## 8. Maintenance, Self-Learning & Extension
### 8.1. Automated Data Refresh
- Schedule regular data extraction from logs, Jira, SCM, and CI reports
- Automate retraining of ML model (monthly or after significant code changes)

### 8.2. Expandability
- Modularize each component with clear interfaces for plugging in new tools (e.g., swap EvoSuite for another generator)
- Document REST/CLI APIs for possible cross-language use and team adoption
- Support onboarding of new microservices with minimal configuration

---

## 9. Documentation and Best Practices
### 9.1. Technical Docs
- Write developer guides for each module and its integration points
- Prepare onboarding materials and requirements checklists
- Document Spring-specific test strategies (mocking, context isolation, Testcontainers)
- Document contract testing and API schema validation

### 9.2. Security and Compliance

## Code & API Extraction
At the end of implementation, the system will have:
- **Automated Java/Spring Source Parsing:** Tools/scripts (Java Reflection, AST, or static analysis) extract all REST endpoints, service methods, and inter-service calls from code. Output includes method/class structure, annotations, HTTP methods, path variables, request/response types, and inter-service communication details.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Contract Extraction:** Automated tools parse OpenAPI specs for each microservice, generating a catalog of endpoints, schemas, and constraints. Contracts are versioned and stored in `/contracts`.
