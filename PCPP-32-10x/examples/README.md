# PCPP Certification - Code Examples

This directory contains practical code examples demonstrating the key concepts covered in the PCPP (Python Certified Professional Programmer) certification.

## Examples Overview

### 1. Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (`01_advanced_oop.py`)
- Multiple inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- Magic methods (dunder methods)
- Properties and descriptors
- Metaclasses
- Comprehensive examples with demonstrations

### 2. GUI Programming with tkinter (`02_gui_programming.py`)
- Basic application structure
- Custom widgets
- Advanced components (Treeview, Canvas)
- Event handling and layout management
- Dialog creation and file operations
- Drawing application example

### 3. Network Programming (`03_network_programming.py`)
- TCP and UDP socket programming
- HTTP client implementation
- Asynchronous networking with asyncio
- WebSocket communication
- Email handling (SMTP/IMAP)
- Comprehensive networking examples

### 4. File Processing & I/O (`04_file_processing.py`)
- Advanced file operations
- Context managers
- JSON and XML processing
- Binary file handling
- Database integration
- Configuration management

### 5. Design Patterns (`05_design_patterns.py`)
- Creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
- Structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
- Behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)
- Real-world implementations

### 6. Testing & Debugging (`06_testing_debugging.py`)
- Unit testing with unittest and pytest
- Mocking and test fixtures
- Debugging techniques
- Performance profiling
- Test-driven development examples

## Running the Examples

Each example file can be run independently:

```bash
python examples/01_advanced_oop.py
python examples/02_gui_programming.py
python examples/03_network_programming.py
# ... and so on
```

## Dependencies

Some examples require additional packages. Install them using:

```bash
pip install aiohttp websockets pytest
```

## Study Tips

1. **Read the code**: Each example is heavily commented to explain concepts
2. **Run the examples**: Execute the code to see it in action
3. **Modify and experiment**: Change parameters and see how behavior changes
4. **Practice variations**: Try implementing similar functionality in different ways
5. **Connect concepts**: See how different topics relate to each other

## Example Structure

Each example file follows this structure:
- **Import statements**: Required modules and libraries
- **Class definitions**: Core implementations
- **Demonstration functions**: Show concepts in action
- **Main execution**: Run examples when file is executed directly

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Clean code**: Well-structured, readable code
- **Error handling**: Proper exception management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- **Testing**: Unit tests where appropriate
- **Performance**: Efficient implementations
- **Security**: Safe coding practices

## Additional Resources

- See `../Notes.md` for detailed theoretical explanations
- Check official Python documentation for deeper understanding
- Practice with the Python Institute's practice tests
- Join Python communities for discussion and help

## Certification Focus Areas

These examples specifically target PCPP certification requirements:
- Advanced Python features
- Object-oriented programming mastery
- GUI development
- Network programming
- File handling and data processing
- Design patterns and best practices
- Testing and debugging techniques

Remember: The key to certification success is understanding concepts deeply and being able to apply them in practical scenarios. Use these examples as a foundation and build upon them with your own projects.
