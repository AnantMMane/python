## üéì Certification Tips

### Exam Strategy
1. **Understand, Don't Memorize** - Focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than memorizing syntax
2. **Practice Coding** - The exam tests practical application, not theoretical knowledge
3. **Time Management** - Practice with timed coding exercises
4. **Read Questions Carefully** - Pay attention to specific requirements and edge cases

### Key Areas to Master
- **Multiple Inheritance** and Method Resolution Order
- **Magic Methods** and operator overloading
- **Context Managers** and resource management
- **Decorators** and metaclasses
- **Async Programming** patterns
- **Testing Strategies** and best practices

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Confusing `__str__` vs `__repr__`
- Not understanding MRO in complex inheritance hierarchies
- Forgetting to handle exceptions in file operations
- Misusing global variables and mutable default arguments
- Not properly closing resources (files, sockets, database connections)

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Applications

The examples include several complete applications:

### 1. **Data Manager Application** (GUI Example)
- Complete CRUD operations with Treeview
- File import/export functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Custom dialogs and error handling

### 2. **Network Chat System** (Network Example)

- WebSocket real-time communication
- Async HTTP client with session management
- Email notification system

### 3. **File Processing Pipeline** (I/O Example)
- JSON/XML/CSV data transformation
- Database integration with SQLite
- Archive creation and extraction
- Configuration management system

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: Some examples require additional packages
```bash
pip install aiohttp websockets pytest
```

**Permission Errors**: Ensure you have write permissions for file operations
```bash
# On Unix/Linux/macOS
chmod +w examples/
```

**Network Examples**: Some network examples require firewall permissions
- Allow Python through your firewall for socket examples
- Check if ports 8080, 8081, 8765 are available

### Getting Help

1. **Check the documentation** in each example file
2. **Read error messages carefully** - they often contain the solution
3. **Use Python's built-in help**:
   ```python
   help(function_name)
   dir(object)
   ```
4. **Debug step by step** using print statements or a debugger
