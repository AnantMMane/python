## ðŸ“š Core Concepts

### Conditional Statements

Conditionals allow your program to make decisions based on conditions:

```python
# Basic if statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")

# if-else statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You cannot vote yet")

# if-elif-else chain
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "F"
print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

### Comparison Operators

Python provides several comparison operators:

```python
# Equality operators
x == y    # Equal to
x != y    # Not equal to

# Relational operators
x < y     # Less than
x <= y    # Less than or equal to
x > y     # Greater than
x >= y    # Greater than or equal to

# Identity operators
x is y    # Same object
x is not y # Different objects

# Membership operators
x in y    # x is a member of y
x not in y # x is not a member of y
```

### Logical Operators

Combine conditions with logical operators:

```python
# AND operator (both conditions must be True)
age = 25
income = 50000
if age >= 18 and income >= 30000:
    print("Eligible for loan")

# OR operator (at least one condition must be True)
is_student = True
is_employed = False
if is_student or is_employed:
    print("Eligible for discount")

# NOT operator (inverts the condition)
is_weekend = False
if not is_weekend:
    print("Time to work!")

# Combining multiple conditions
temperature = 75
humidity = 60
if temperature > 70 and humidity < 80 and not is_weekend:
    print("Perfect day for outdoor activities")
```

### Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operators)

Python's concise conditional expressions:

```python
# Traditional if-else
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    status = "adult"
else:
    status = "minor"

# Ternary operator (more concise)
status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"

# Multiple conditions
grade = "A" if score >= 90 else "B" if score >= 80 else "C" if score >= 70 else "F"
```

## ðŸ’» Hands-On Practice

### Exercise 1: Basic Conditionals

Create a simple grading system:

```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    """Calculate letter grade based on numerical score."""
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def check_eligibility(age, income, credit_score):
    """Check loan eligibility based on multiple criteria."""
    if age >= 18 and income >= 30000 and credit_score >= 650:
        return "Eligible"
    elif age >= 18 and income >= 50000:
        return "Eligible with co-signer"
    else:
        return "Not eligible"

# Test the functions
print(calculate_grade(85))  # Output: B
print(check_eligibility(25, 45000, 700))  # Output: Eligible
```

### Exercise 2: For Loops

Master iteration with for loops:

```python
# Iterating over a range
print("Counting from 1 to 5:")
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Number: {i}")

# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print("\nFruits in the basket:")
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"- {fruit}")

# Iterating with enumerate (get index and value)
print("\nFruits with position:")
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, 1):
    print(f"{index}. {fruit}")

# Iterating over a dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "Boston"}
print("\nPerson details:")
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# List comprehension with conditions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(f"\nSquares of even numbers: {even_squares}")
```

### Exercise 3: While Loops

Use while loops for condition-based repetition:

```python
def countdown(n):
    """Countdown from n to 1."""
    while n > 0:
        print(f"Countdown: {n}")
        n -= 1
    print("Blast off!")

def find_factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial using while loop."""
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial not defined for negative numbers"
    
    result = 1
    i = n
    while i > 1:
        result *= i
        i -= 1
    
    return result

def password_checker():
    """Simple password checker with retry limit."""
    correct_password = "secret123"
    max_attempts = 3
    attempts = 0
    
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        password = input("Enter password: ")
        if password == correct_password:
            print("Access granted!")
            return True
        else:
            attempts += 1
            remaining = max_attempts - attempts
            if remaining > 0:
                print(f"Wrong password. {remaining} attempts remaining.")
            else:
                print("Access denied. Too many failed attempts.")
    
    return False

# Test the functions
countdown(5)
print(f"Factorial of 5: {find_factorial(5)}")
# password_checker()  # Uncomment to test interactively
```

### Exercise 4: Nested Control Structures

Combine conditionals and loops:

```python
def analyze_numbers(numbers):
    """Analyze a list of numbers with nested control structures."""
    if not numbers:
        print("No numbers to analyze")
        return
    
    positive_count = 0
    negative_count = 0
    zero_count = 0
    even_sum = 0
    odd_sum = 0
    
    for num in numbers:
        # Count positive, negative, and zero
        if num > 0:
            positive_count += 1
        elif num < 0:
            negative_count += 1
        else:
            zero_count += 1
        
        # Sum even and odd numbers
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
        else:
            odd_sum += num
    
    # Print analysis
    print("Number Analysis:")
    print(f"Positive numbers: {positive_count}")
    print(f"Negative numbers: {negative_count}")
    print(f"Zeros: {zero_count}")
    print(f"Sum of even numbers: {even_sum}")
    print(f"Sum of odd numbers: {odd_sum}")

def multiplication_table(n):
    """Print multiplication table with nested loops."""
    if n <= 0:
        print("Please enter a positive number")
        return
    
    print(f"Multiplication table for {n}:")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    for i in range(1, 11):
        result = n * i
        print(f"{n} x {i:2d} = {result:3d}")

# Test the functions
sample_numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 0, 6, -7, 8, 0, -10]
analyze_numbers(sample_numbers)
print()
multiplication_table(7)
```

### Exercise 5: Loop Control Statements

Master break, continue, and pass:

```python
def find_first_even(numbers):
    """Find the first even number in a list."""
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            print(f"First even number found: {num}")
            break
    else:
        print("No even numbers found")

def skip_negative_numbers(numbers):
    """Sum positive numbers, skipping negative ones."""
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            continue  # Skip negative numbers
        total += num
        print(f"Added {num}, total: {total}")
    return total

def process_data(data):
    """Process data with different actions based on type."""
    for item in data:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            # Process strings
            if item.startswith('#'):
                continue  # Skip comments
            print(f"Processing string: {item}")
        elif isinstance(item, int):
            # Process integers
            if item == 0:
                pass  # Do nothing for zero
            else:
                print(f"Processing integer: {item}")
        else:
            # Handle other types
            print(f"Unknown type: {type(item).__name__}")

# Test the functions
print("Finding first even number:")
find_first_even([1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10])

print("\nSumming positive numbers:")
total = skip_negative_numbers([1, -2, 3, -4, 5])
print(f"Final total: {total}")

print("\nProcessing mixed data:")
mixed_data = ["hello", "#comment", 42, 0, "world", 3.14]
process_data(mixed_data)
```

## ðŸ§ª Module Quiz

Test your understanding with these questions:

### Question 1
What is the output of this code?
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("A")
elif x > 2:
    print("B")
else:
    print("C")
```
- A) A
- B) B
- C) C
- D) A and B

**Answer: A** - Only the first true condition executes.

### Question 2
Which loop is best for iterating over a list when you need the index?
- A) `for item in list:`
- B) `for i in range(len(list)):`
- C) `for index, item in enumerate(list):`
- D) `while i < len(list):`

**Answer: C** - `enumerate()` provides both index and value efficiently.

### Question 3
What does the `break` statement do in a loop?
- A) Skips the current iteration
- B) Exits the loop completely
- C) Continues to the next iteration
- D) Pauses the loop

**Answer: B** - `break` exits the loop immediately.

### Question 4
What is the purpose of the `pass` statement?
- A) To exit a function
- B) To skip an iteration
- C) To do nothing (placeholder)
- D) To raise an exception

**Answer: C** - `pass` is a placeholder that does nothing.

### Question 5
Which operator has the highest precedence?
- A) `and`
- B) `or`
- C) `not`
- D) `==`

**Answer: C** - `not` has the highest precedence among logical operators.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Review

### Control Flow Best Practices
1. **Use clear, descriptive conditions** for readability
2. **Avoid deeply nested structures** (use functions to break complexity)
3. **Choose appropriate loop types** for your use case
4. **Use break and continue sparingly** to maintain code clarity
5. **Always handle edge cases** in your conditions

### Loop Selection Guidelines
- **for loops**: When you know the number of iterations or iterating over collections
- **while loops**: When you don't know the number of iterations in advance
- **List comprehensions**: For simple transformations and filtering
- **Nested loops**: Use when necessary, but consider if there's a better approach

### Performance Considerations
- **Avoid unnecessary computations** in loop conditions
- **Use appropriate data structures** for efficient iteration
- **Consider using generators** for large datasets
- **Profile your code** if performance is critical
