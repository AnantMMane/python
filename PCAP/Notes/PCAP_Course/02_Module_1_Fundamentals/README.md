### Section 2: Python Language Overview

#### What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity.

#### Python Philosophy
The Zen of Python (PEP 20) captures Python's design philosophy:
```python
import this
```

Key principles include:
- **Readability counts**: Code should be easy to read and understand
- **Simple is better than complex**: Prefer simple solutions
- **Explicit is better than implicit**: Make intentions clear
- **There should be one obvious way to do it**: Python encourages consistent approaches

#### Key Features

**Interpreted Language**
- No compilation step needed
- Code runs directly from source
- Faster development cycle
- Platform independence

**Cross-Platform**
- Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix
- Same code works everywhere
- Consistent behavior across platforms

**Dynamic Typing**
- Variable types determined at runtime
- No need to declare types
- Flexible and convenient
- Can lead to runtime errors if not careful

**Automatic Memory Management**
- Garbage collection handles memory
- No manual memory management
- Prevents memory leaks
- Slightly slower than manual management

**Rich Standard Library**
- "Batteries included" philosophy

### Section 4: Running Python Programs

#### Interactive Mode (Python Shell)
```bash
# Start Python interactive shell
python  # or python3 on macOS/Linux

# You'll see the Python prompt: >>>
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> exit()  # or Ctrl+D (macOS/Linux), Ctrl+Z (Windows)
```

**Interactive Mode Advantages**
- Immediate feedback
- Great for learning and testing
- No need to create files
- Experiment with code snippets

**Interactive Mode Limitations**
- Code is not saved
- Limited to simple operations
- Not suitable for complex programs
- No version control

#### Script Mode
```bash
# Create a Python file
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
print("This is a Python script!")

# Run the script
python hello.py  # or python3 hello.py
```

**Script Mode Advantages**
- Code is saved and reusable
- Can create complex programs
- Version control friendly
- Professional development workflow

#### Python File Extensions
- **`.py`**: Python source files (standard)
- **`.pyc`**: Compiled bytecode files (automatic)
- **`.pyo`**: Optimized bytecode files (deprecated)
- **`.pyw`**: Python script for Windows (no console)

### Section 5: Syntax Fundamentals

#### Indentation
Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of braces or keywords.

```python
# Correct indentation
if True:
    print("This is indented")
    print("This is also indented")
    if False:
        print("This is nested indentation")

# Incorrect indentation (IndentationError)
if True:
print("This will cause an error")  # IndentationError
```

**Indentation Rules**
- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs, not mixed)
- Standard is 4 spaces per level
- Indentation defines code blocks
- All statements in a block must have the same indentation

#### Comments
```python
# Single line comment

"""
Multi-line comment
or docstring
"""

'''
Another way to write
multi-line comments
'''

def function():
    """This is a docstring - describes what the function does"""
    pass
```

**Comment Best Practices**
- Use comments to explain "why", not "what"
- Keep comments up to date with code
- Use docstrings for functions and classes
- Avoid obvious or redundant comments

#### Statement Separators
```python
# Multiple statements on one line (not recommended)
a = 1; b = 2; c = 3

# Preferred: One statement per line
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

# Line continuation for long statements
long_string = ("This is a very long string "
               "that spans multiple lines "
               "for better readability")
```

## 💻 Hands-On Practice

### Exercise 1: Your First Python Program
Create a file called `first_program.py` with the following content:

```python
# My First Python Program
# This program demonstrates basic Python concepts

# Variables and assignment
name = "Student"
age = 25
is_student = True

# Output using print()
print("Hello, World!")
print(f"My name is {name}")
print(f"I am {age} years old")
print(f"Am I a student? {is_student}")

# Basic arithmetic
x = 10
y = 5
print(f"{x} + {y} = {x + y}")
print(f"{x} * {y} = {x * y}")
print(f"{x} / {y} = {x / y}")

# String operations
greeting = "Welcome to Python!"
print(greeting.upper())
print(greeting.lower())
print(f"Length of greeting: {len(greeting)}")
```

**Run your program:**
```bash
python first_program.py
```

### Exercise 2: Interactive Python Shell
1. Open Python interactive shell: `python` or `python3`
2. Try these commands:
   ```python
   >>> 2 + 2
   >>> "Hello" + " " + "World"
   >>> len("Python")
   >>> type(42)
   >>> type("Hello")
   >>> exit()
   ```

### Exercise 3: Environment Exploration
Create a script to explore your Python environment:

```python
# environment_info.py
import sys
import platform
import os

print("Python Environment Information")
print("=" * 40)

print(f"Python Version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Python Executable: {sys.executable}")
print(f"Platform: {platform.system()} {platform.release()}")
print(f"Architecture: {platform.machine()}")
print(f"Current Directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# Check if running in virtual environment
if hasattr(sys, 'real_prefix') or (hasattr(sys, 'base_prefix') and sys.base_prefix != sys.prefix):
    print("Virtual Environment: Yes")
else:
    print("Virtual Environment: No")
```
